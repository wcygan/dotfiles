## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- K8s config: !`kubectl config current-context 2>/dev/null || echo "No kubectl context"`
- K8s cluster info: !`kubectl cluster-info --short 2>/dev/null || echo "No cluster connection"`
- K8s manifests: !`fd "\.(yaml|yml)$" . | rg -l "(apiVersion|kind)" | head -10 || echo "No K8s manifests found"`
- Helm charts: !`fd "Chart\.(yaml|yml)$" . | head -5 || echo "No Helm charts found"`
- K8s tools: !`which kubectl helm kustomize 2>/dev/null || echo "No K8s tools detected"`
- Namespaces: !`kubectl get namespaces --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Running pods: !`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Technology stack: !`fd "(deno\.json|package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod)" . | head -3 || echo "K8s-only project"`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize context loading session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/k8s-context-$SESSION_ID.json`
- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "phase": "discovery",
    "cluster_context": null,
    "context_sources": [],
    "loaded_topics": [],
    "k8s_features_detected": [],
    "documentation_cache": {}
  }
  ```

STEP 2: Kubernetes environment analysis

- ANALYZE cluster connectivity and context from Context section
- DETERMINE active Kubernetes features and configurations
- IDENTIFY documentation priorities based on detected environment

IF cluster connection available:

- FOCUS on operational guides, troubleshooting, and cluster management
- PRIORITIZE monitoring, networking, and security documentation
- INCLUDE deployment patterns and best practices for detected workloads

ELSE IF K8s manifests found:

- FOCUS on resource definitions, configuration patterns, and deployment strategies
- PRIORITIZE YAML reference documentation and validation guides
- INCLUDE development workflow and CI/CD integration patterns

ELSE:

- LOAD general Kubernetes foundation and getting-started guides
- EMPHASIZE core concepts, setup guides, and learning resources
- INCLUDE cluster setup and tool installation documentation

STEP 3: Strategic documentation loading

Think deeply about optimal Kubernetes learning and operational documentation strategies for this specific environment.

TRY:

- EXECUTE systematic context loading from prioritized sources

CATCH (documentation_fetch_failed):

- LOG failed sources to session state
- CONTINUE with available documentation
- PROVIDE manual context loading instructions
- SAVE fallback documentation references

STEP 4: Environment-specific context optimization

CASE k8s_environment:
WHEN "production_cluster":

- PRIORITIZE: Monitoring, security, troubleshooting, upgrades
- FOCUS: Production best practices, disaster recovery, performance tuning
- EXAMPLES: High availability patterns, security hardening

STEP 7: Session state management and completion

TRY:

- UPDATE session state with loaded context summary
- SAVE context cache: `/tmp/k8s-context-cache-$SESSION_ID.json`
- CREATE context summary report
- MARK completion checkpoint

CATCH (context_organization_failed):

- SAVE partial context loading results
- DOCUMENT missing context areas
- PROVIDE manual context completion steps

FINALLY:

- ARCHIVE context session data for future reference
- PROVIDE context loading summary with coverage metrics
- CLEAN UP temporary session files

## Context Loading Strategy

**Adaptive Loading Based on Environment:**

CASE environment_type:

- FOCUS: Package management and release workflows

WHEN "kustomize_usage":

- PRIORITIZE: Kustomize documentation, overlay patterns
- LOAD: Configuration management and environment promotion
- FOCUS: GitOps workflows and configuration templating

**Context Validation and Quality Assurance:**

FOR EACH loaded documentation source:

- VERIFY documentation currency and Kubernetes version compatibility
- VALIDATE example manifests for syntax correctness
- CHECK for deprecated APIs and migration paths
- ENSURE security best practices are highlighted
- CONFIRM examples work with detected Kubernetes version
