I'll help you implement the feature using Test-Driven Development (TDD). We'll follow these steps:

1. First, I'll analyze the requirements for $ARGUMENTS
2. I'll create comprehensive tests that define the expected behavior
3. I'll verify the tests fail (red)
4. I'll implement the minimum code needed to pass the tests (green)
5. I'll refactor the code while keeping tests passing (refactor)

Let's start by understanding what we're building and creating a test plan. What specifically should $ARGUMENTS do, and what edge cases should we consider?

Remember our TDD principles:
- Tests must be written before implementation code
- Tests must fail initially to prove they're testing something real
- Implementation should be the minimum necessary to pass tests
- Refactoring should maintain passing tests
- Follow the Three-Stage Component Testing approach:
  1. Storybook isolation
  2. Test harness integration
  3. System integration

I'll help you through each phase of this TDD process for $ARGUMENTS.
