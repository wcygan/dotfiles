## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize epic orchestration session and analyze scope

- CREATE epic session state: `/tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json`
- ANALYZE target scope from $ARGUMENTS
- DETERMINE epic type: migration, refactoring, feature-rollout, infrastructure
- IDENTIFY affected repositories and services from Context section

```bash
# Initialize epic orchestration session
echo '{
  "sessionId": "'$SESSION_ID'",
  "epicTarget": "'$ARGUMENTS'",
  "epicType": "auto-detect",
  "affectedRepositories": [],
  "estimatedComplexity": "unknown",
  "coordinationStrategy": "parallel"
}' > /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json
```

fd . -t d -d 2 | head -10

# Check for monorepo services
if fd "(package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml)" . -d 3 | wc -l | grep -v "^[01]$" >/dev/null; then
  echo "🔍 Monorepo structure detected - multiple services found"
else
  echo "📦 Single repository detected"
fi
```

**Epic Impact Assessment:**

```bash
# Generate comprehensive impact analysis
echo "📊 Epic Impact Analysis:"

echo "Estimated complexity: $(jq -r '.estimatedComplexity' /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json)"
echo "Coordination strategy: $(jq -r '.coordinationStrategy' /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json)"

# Technology stack analysis
echo "🔧 Technology stack:"
fd "(package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml|deno\.json)" . | \
  rg -o "(package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml|deno\.json)" | \
  sort | uniq -c
```

STEP 3: Master epic plan generation with programmatic structure

  - Output: Integration test results and performance benchmarks

### Phase 5: Cleanup and Epic Consolidation (Week 12)

**Goal**: Finalize epic and consolidate all changes

**Epic Consolidation Strategy**:

```bash
# Consolidate all worktree changes back to main repositories
echo "🔄 Consolidating epic changes..."
FOR worktree IN epic_worktrees:
  cd $worktree

CATCH (epic_implementation_failed):

- LOG comprehensive error details to epic session state
- TRIGGER automatic rollback procedures for affected services
- PRESERVE work in progress via git worktrees
- GENERATE post-mortem analysis and lessons learned

## Risk Mitigation & Rollback Strategy

### High-Risk Items with Automated Handling

1. **Coordination Complexity**: Multiple teams and repositories
   - **Mitigation**: Git worktrees provide complete isolation
   - **Rollback**: Each worktree can be rolled back independently
   - **Automation**: `/tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json` tracks all states

2. **Integration Conflicts**: Cross-service compatibility
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing in Phase 4
   - **Rollback**: Feature flags enable instant traffic switching
   - **Automation**: Automated rollback triggers based on error rates

3. **Performance Regression**: Epic implementation overhead
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel performance testing throughout implementation
   - **Rollback**: Git worktrees enable rapid reversion
   - **Automation**: Performance monitoring with automatic alerts

### Epic Rollback Coordination

```bash
# Epic-wide rollback procedure
echo "🚨 Initiating epic rollback..."
echo "Rollback target: $1" # phase number or 'full'

# Rollback all worktrees to specified checkpoint
FOR worktree IN $(git worktree list | grep epic-$SESSION_ID | cut -f1 -d' '):
  cd $worktree
  git reset --hard epic-checkpoint-$1
  cd -
done

# Update epic coordination state
jq '.status = "rollback" | .rollbackTarget = "'$1'"' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp
mv /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json
```

STEP 4: Resource allocation and team coordination setup

### Git Worktree Team Allocation

```bash
# Automatic team assignment based on repository analysis
echo "👥 Team allocation strategy:"
echo "Epic Coordinator: $(git config user.name)"
echo "Session ID: $SESSION_ID"
echo "Affected repositories: $(jq '.affectedRepositories | length' /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json)"

# Create team assignment in coordination state
jq '.teamAllocation = {
  "epicCoordinator": "'$(git config user.name)'",
  "sessionId": "'$SESSION_ID'",
  "worktreeStrategy": "parallel-isolation",
  "coordinationMethod": "shared-state-files"
}' /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.tmp
mv /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json
```

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **Git worktrees**: Parallel development isolation for each service
- **Shared coordination state**: `/tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json`
- **Performance testing**: Automated benchmarking in each worktree
- **Monitoring integration**: Real-time epic progress tracking

## Communication & Coordination

### Automated Status Tracking

```bash
# Real-time epic status command
/epic status
# Displays:
# - Current phase and completion percentage
# - Worktree status for each service
# - Integration test results
# - Performance benchmarks
# - Risk assessment and blockers
```

### Shared State Coordination

- **Epic coordination**: `/tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json`
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates from all worktrees
- **Status reporting**: Automated generation from shared state
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated from implementation progress

### Git Worktree Communication Pattern

```bash
# Each worktree updates shared coordination state
echo "📊 Updating epic coordination state..."
jq '.repositories["'$CURRENT_SERVICE'"] = {
  "status": "'$STATUS'",
  "worktree": "'$PWD'",
  "progress": '$PROGRESS',
  "lastUpdate": "'$(gdate -Iseconds)'"
}' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp
mv /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json
```

STEP 5: Epic execution and coordination management

### Dependency Management

```bash
# Automated dependency checking
echo "🔗 Checking epic dependencies..."
jq -r '.dependencies[]?' /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json 2>/dev/null || echo "  - Dependencies auto-detected from repository analysis"

# Cross-service dependency validation
FOR service IN affected_services:
  echo "Validating $service dependencies..."
  # Check if dependent services are ready
done
```

### Automated Blocker Detection

```bash
# Real-time blocker identification
echo "⚠️ Epic blockers analysis:"
jq -r '.blockers[]?' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json 2>/dev/null || echo "  - No blockers detected"

# Performance regression detection
echo "📈 Performance regression monitoring active"
```

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Automated Performance Validation

```bash
# Epic performance metrics collection
echo "📊 Epic performance metrics:"
echo "Baseline metrics: $(jq -r '.performanceBaseline' /tmp/epic-session-$SESSION_ID.json 2>/dev/null || echo 'Collecting...')"
echo "Current metrics: $(jq -r '.currentPerformance' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json 2>/dev/null || echo 'Monitoring...')"
```

### Quality Assurance Targets

- Zero production incidents during epic implementation
- 100% test coverage across all affected services
- Complete documentation auto-generated from implementation
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking

### Epic Success Validation

```bash
# Automated success criteria validation
echo "✅ Epic success validation:"
echo "Target achieved: $ARGUMENTS"
echo "All services migrated: $(jq -r '.allServicesMigrated' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)"
echo "Performance targets met: $(jq -r '.performanceTargetsMet' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)"
echo "Zero incidents: $(jq -r '.zeroIncidents' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)"
```

STEP 6: Repository-specific plan generation with sub-agent delegation

LAUNCH parallel sub-agents for repository-specific planning:

FOR EACH repository IN affected_repositories:

- **Repository Planning Agent {repository}**: Generate tailored PLAN.md
  - Focus: Repository-specific implementation strategy, testing approach, deployment plan
  - Tools: Read existing code, analyze patterns, create comprehensive PLAN.md
  - Output: Complete repository migration plan with git worktree integration

**Example Generated Service Plan Template:**

````markdown
# {Service} Epic Implementation Plan

## Epic Integration

- **Epic Session ID**: $SESSION_ID
- **Epic Target**: $ARGUMENTS
- **Service Worktree**: ../epic-{service}-$SESSION_ID
- **Coordination State**: /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json

## Implementation Strategy

### STEP 1: Worktree Setup and Isolation

```bash
# Create dedicated worktree for this service
git worktree add ../epic-{service}-$SESSION_ID epic/$EPIC_ID-{service}
cd ../epic-{service}-$SESSION_ID

# Update coordination state
jq '.repositories["{service}"] = {
  "status": "worktree-created",
  "worktree": "'$PWD'",
  "startTime": "'$(gdate -Iseconds)'"
}' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp
```
````

### STEP 2: Implementation Following Epic Guidelines

- [ ] Implement epic target: $ARGUMENTS
- [ ] Follow service-specific patterns and requirements
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Update coordination state after each major step

### STEP 3: Integration with Epic Coordination

- [ ] Regular status updates to shared coordination state
- [ ] Integration testing with other epic services
- [ ] Performance validation and benchmarking
- [ ] Documentation and runbook updates

### STEP 4: Epic Consolidation

- [ ] Create pull request for epic implementation
- [ ] Coordinate merge with other epic services
- [ ] Clean up worktree after successful integration

````
STEP 7: Cross-repository coordination with shared state management

**Epic Coordination State Management:**

```bash
# Initialize comprehensive coordination state
echo '{
  "epicId": "epic-'$SESSION_ID'",
  "epicTarget": "'$ARGUMENTS'",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "currentPhase": "phase_1",
  "sessionId": "'$SESSION_ID'",
  "initiatedBy": "'$(git config user.name)'",
  "startTime": "'$(gdate -Iseconds)'",
  "repositories": {},
  "worktrees": {},
  "milestones": {
    "phase_1_target": "'$(gdate -d '+1 week' -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -d '+1 week' -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || echo 'Week 1')'",
    "phase_2_target": "'$(gdate -d '+3 weeks' -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -d '+3 weeks' -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || echo 'Week 3')'",
    "epic_completion_target": "'$(gdate -d '+12 weeks' -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -d '+12 weeks' -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || echo 'Week 12')'"
  },
  "performanceBaseline": {},
  "risks": [],
  "blockers": []
}' > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json
````

**Real-time Coordination Monitoring:**

```bash
# Epic status command for real-time monitoring
alias epic-status='jq -r "Epic: \(.epicTarget) | Status: \(.status) | Phase: \(.currentPhase) | Repositories: \(.repositories | length)" /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json'

# Repository status summary
alias epic-repos='jq -r ".repositories | to_entries[] | \"\(.key): \(.value.status) (\(.value.progress // 0)%)\"" /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json'
```

STEP 8: Epic orchestration and automation with modern tooling

**Epic Management Commands:**

```bash
# Epic orchestration functions
epic_status() {
  echo "📊 Epic Status: $(jq -r '.status' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)"
  echo "🎯 Current Phase: $(jq -r '.currentPhase' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)"
  echo "📁 Repositories: $(jq -r '.repositories | length' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)"

  # Update coordination state
  jq '.currentPhase = "phase_'$PHASE'" | .phases["phase_'$PHASE'"].startTime = "'$(gdate -Iseconds)'"' \
    /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp
  mv /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json
  
  # Launch sub-agents for parallel phase execution
  echo "🔄 Launching parallel sub-agents for phase $PHASE..."
}

epic_create_worktrees() {
  echo "🌿 Creating git worktrees for parallel development..."
  
  jq -r '.repositories | keys[]' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json | while read repo; do
    local worktree_path="../epic-$repo-$SESSION_ID"
    git worktree add $worktree_path epic/$SESSION_ID-$repo
    
    # Update coordination state with worktree info
    jq '.worktrees["'$repo'"] = {
      "path": "'$worktree_path'",
      "branch": "epic/'$SESSION_ID'-'$repo'",
      "createdAt": "'$(gdate -Iseconds)'"
    }' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp
    mv /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json
    
    echo "  ✅ Created worktree: $worktree_path"
  done
}

epic_create_prs() {
  echo "🔄 Creating pull requests for all epic services..."
  
  jq -r '.worktrees | to_entries[]' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json | while read worktree_info; do
    local repo=$(echo $worktree_info | jq -r '.key')
    local path=$(echo $worktree_info | jq -r '.value.path')
    
    cd $path
    gh pr create --title "Epic: $ARGUMENTS - $repo" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Epic Implementation

- Epic Session: $SESSION_ID
- Epic Target: $ARGUMENTS
- Repository: $repo

## Changes

- Implemented epic target for $repo
- Following epic coordination strategy
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## Epic Coordination

- Coordination state: `/tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json`
- Worktree path: $path

EOF
)"
    cd -
  done
}
```

STEP 9: Automated progress tracking and epic dashboard generation

**Real-time Epic Dashboard Generation:**

```bash
# Generate epic dashboard from coordination state
epic_generate_dashboard() {
  local epic_target=$(jq -r '.epicTarget' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)
  local current_phase=$(jq -r '.currentPhase' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)
  local session_id=$(jq -r '.sessionId' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)
  
  cat > epic-dashboard-$SESSION_ID.md <<EOF
# Epic Progress Dashboard: $epic_target

## Epic Overview
- **Session ID**: $session_id
- **Epic Target**: $epic_target
- **Current Phase**: $current_phase
- **Started**: $(jq -r '.startTime' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)
- **Coordinator**: $(jq -r '.initiatedBy' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)

## Repository Status
$(jq -r '.repositories | to_entries[] | "- **\(.key)**: \(.value.status) (\(.value.progress // 0)%)"' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)

## Worktree Status
$(jq -r '.worktrees | to_entries[] | "- **\(.key)**: \(.value.path) (\(.value.branch))"' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)

## Current Blockers
$(jq -r '.blockers[]?' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/- /' || echo "- No blockers detected")

## Performance Metrics
- **Baseline**: $(jq -r '.performanceBaseline // "Collecting..."' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)
- **Current**: $(jq -r '.currentPerformance // "Monitoring..."' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)

## Next Actions
- Continue current phase implementation
- Monitor worktree progress
- Update coordination state regularly

---
*Auto-generated from epic coordination state at $(gdate)*
EOF

  echo "📊 Epic dashboard generated: epic-dashboard-$SESSION_ID.md"
}
```

**Automated Progress Reporting:**

```bash
# Real-time progress updates
epic_update_progress() {
  local repo=$1
  local status=$2
  local progress=$3
  
  jq '.repositories["'$repo'"].status = "'$status'" |
      .repositories["'$repo'"].progress = '$progress' |
      .repositories["'$repo'"].lastUpdate = "'$(gdate -Iseconds)'"' \
    /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json > /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp
  mv /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.tmp /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json
  
  echo "📈 Updated $repo: $status ($progress%)"
}
```

FINALLY:

- SAVE epic session state for resumability
- GENERATE comprehensive epic plan and coordination infrastructure
- PROVIDE epic management commands for ongoing coordination
- ENSURE all git worktrees are properly configured for parallel development

## Epic Command Usage Examples

### Start a new epic:

```
/epic "Migrate all services from REST to gRPC"
```

### Check epic status:

```
/epic status
# Real-time status from coordination state
```

### Continue epic work:

```

```
/epic dashboard
# Creates epic-dashboard-$SESSION_ID.md
```

## Advanced Epic Coordination Features

### Automatic Git Worktree Management

```bash
# Epic automatically creates isolated development environments
echo "🌿 Creating epic worktree infrastructure..."
FOR service IN affected_services:
  git worktree add ../epic-$service-$SESSION_ID epic/$SESSION_ID-$service
  echo "  ✅ Worktree: ../epic-$service-$SESSION_ID"
done
```

### Epic Dependency Graph Generation

```bash

  cat > epic-dependencies-$SESSION_ID.mermaid <<EOF
graph TD
$(jq -r '.repositories | to_entries[] | "    \(.key)[\(.key)]"' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json)
$(jq -r '.dependencies[]?' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/    /' || echo "    # Dependencies auto-detected")
EOF

  echo "📈 Dependency graph: epic-dependencies-$SESSION_ID.mermaid"
}
```

### Epic Integration Testing Coordination

```bash

epic_run_integration_tests() {
  echo "🧪 Running epic integration tests..."
  
  # Test each worktree in parallel
  jq -r '.worktrees | to_entries[]' /tmp/epic-coordination-$SESSION_ID.json | while read worktree_info; do
    local repo=$(echo $worktree_info | jq -r '.key')
    local path=$(echo $worktree_info | jq -r '.value.path')
    
    (
      cd $path
      echo "Testing $repo in worktree $path..."
      # Run repository-specific tests
      deno task test 2>/dev/null || npm test 2>/dev/null || cargo test 2>/dev/null || mvn test 2>/dev/null || echo "No test command found for $repo"
