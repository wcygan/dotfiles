description: Analyze design problem and suggest 2-3 approaches with tradeoffs and recommendation
---

Analyze the design problem or decision the user describes and provide 2-3 viable approaches.

**Analysis structure:**

## Problem Understanding
- Restate the design challenge clearly
- Identify key constraints and requirements
- Note any assumptions being made

## Approach 1: [Name]
**Description:** Brief overview of this approach

**Implementation:**
- Key steps or components
- Technologies/patterns involved

**Pros:**
- ✅ Advantage 1
- ✅ Advantage 2
- ✅ Advantage 3

**Cons:**
- ❌ Drawback 1
- ❌ Drawback 2
- ❌ Drawback 3

**Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]  
**Risk:** [Low/Medium/High]

## Approach 2: [Name]
**Description:** Brief overview of this approach

**Implementation:**
- Key steps or components
- Technologies/patterns involved

**Pros:**
- ✅ Advantage 1
- ✅ Advantage 2
- ✅ Advantage 3

**Cons:**
- ❌ Drawback 1
- ❌ Drawback 2
- ❌ Drawback 3

**Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]  
**Risk:** [Low/Medium/High]

## Approach 3: [Name]
*(Include if a third distinct approach exists)*

**Description:** Brief overview of this approach

**Implementation:**
- Key steps or components
- Technologies/patterns involved

**Pros:**
- ✅ Advantage 1
- ✅ Advantage 2
- ✅ Advantage 3

**Cons:**
- ❌ Drawback 1
- ❌ Drawback 2
- ❌ Drawback 3

**Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]  
**Risk:** [Low/Medium/High]

## Recommendation

**Recommended approach:** [Approach Name]

**Rationale:**
- Why this approach best fits the constraints
- What specific advantages make it superior
- How it mitigates the most critical risks
- What tradeoffs are acceptable

**Implementation roadmap:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

**Success criteria:**
- How to measure if this approach is working
- What metrics to track

**Fallback plan:**
- If this approach doesn't work, which alternative to pivot to
- Early warning signs to watch for

**Decision-making principles:**
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness
- Consider maintainability and team expertise
- Balance short-term delivery with long-term sustainability
- Account for testing and observability
- Evaluate reversibility (can we change our mind later?)
