# Document Standards

Conventions that apply across all 9 output documents. Agents must follow these for consistency.

## File Naming

```
{sequence:02d}-{kebab-case-name}.md
```

| Sequence | Document |
|----------|----------|
| 00 | INDEX (generated by orchestrator) |
| 01 | product-thesis |
| 02 | feature-priority-matrix |
| 03 | mvp-scope-contract |
| 04 | core-user-journeys |
| 05 | domain-model |
| 06 | system-architecture |
| 07 | revenue-pricing-model |
| 08 | api-surface-spec |
| 09 | design-system-brief |

## YAML Frontmatter

Every document starts with:

```yaml
---
type: clone-research
document: "{document name}"
target: "{company name}"
date: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
tier: {1 or 2}
sequence: {NN}
---
```

## Feature Tagging

Features are tagged in `02-feature-priority-matrix.md` with IDs: `F1`, `F2`, `F3`, etc.

Other documents reference features by this ID:
- Domain Model: "Supports F3, F7"
- MVP Scope: "F1 (P0), F4 (P1)"
- API Surface: "Endpoint serves F2"
- User Journeys: "Journey uses F1, F3, F5"

## Entity Naming

Entities defined in `05-domain-model.md` use **PascalCase**: `User`, `Workspace`, `Project`, `Task`.

The same names must be used consistently in:
- `06-system-architecture.md` — service/module names
- `08-api-surface-spec.md` — resource names in endpoints
- `04-core-user-journeys.md` — objects in journey steps

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Evidence Requirement |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **High** | Confirmed via official source | Company website, docs, blog, press release |
| **Medium** | Inferred from multiple signals | Reviews, job postings, StackShare, DNS/headers |
| **Low** | Single weak signal or educated guess | One third-party mention, pattern matching |

Always state the confidence level and the evidence supporting it.

## Priority & Effort Scales

**Priority** (used in Feature Matrix, MVP Scope):

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| P0 | Launch blocker — cannot ship without |
| P1 | Needed within 3 months for competitive parity |
| P2 | Differentiation — target within 6 months |
| P3 | Nice-to-have — backlog |

**Effort** (used in Feature Matrix, MVP Scope):

| Effort | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| S | < 1 week |
| M | 1-2 weeks |
| L | 2-4 weeks |
| XL | > 4 weeks |

**Impact** (used in Feature Matrix):

| Impact | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| High | Core to value proposition or retention |
| Medium | Improves experience but not decisive |
| Low | Convenience feature |

## Citations

### Inline Format

```markdown
Linear uses a local-first sync engine [Linear Blog](https://linear.app/blog/...) for sub-50ms interactions.
```

### Sources Section

Every document ends with:

```markdown
## Sources

- [Source Title](url) — brief description of what was found
- [Source Title](url) — brief description
```

### Unverified Information

Prefix with qualifier:

```markdown
**Estimated**: Revenue is approximately $50M ARR based on employee count and pricing.
**Unverified**: May use WebSockets for real-time sync (inferred from network inspection).
```

## Cross-References

Use `**Xref:**` markers to link between documents:

```markdown
**Xref:** See [02-feature-priority-matrix.md](02-feature-priority-matrix.md) F3-F7 for related features.
**Xref:** Domain entities defined in [05-domain-model.md](05-domain-model.md).
```

Place cross-references at the end of relevant sections, not inline.
